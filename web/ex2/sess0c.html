These mutations follow patterns, but because mutations are somewhat random the patterns are occasionally broken. Your job is to learn the relationships among the fractals so that you can make any particular fractal on demand, by using acid (pressing 'a' on your keyboard) or gamma rays (pressing 'g')."
