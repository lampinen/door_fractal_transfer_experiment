These creatures form strange fractal colonies in a petri dish. It was accidentally discovered that pouring sulfuric acid onto the creatures or zapping them with gamma rays will cause them to mutate into one of the other fractals. These mutations follow patterns. Your job is to learn the relationships among the fractals so that you can make any particular fractal on demand, by using acid (pressing 'a' on your keyboard) or gamma rays (pressing 'g'). After you make each fractal, we'll give you feedback on how well you did."
